-------Using subquery:-------------
SELECT MAX(salary) AS second_highest_salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);

SELECT MAX(salary) AS second_highest_salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary NOT IN (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);

------------Using limit:------------------

SELECT DISTINCT salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;

------------Using dense rank:-----------------

SELECT salary
FROM (
    SELECT salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
    FROM employees
) ranked_salaries
WHERE salary_rank = 2;


--------------With correlated sub query:-------------

SELECT SALARY FROM EMPLOYEE E1 WHERE N-1=(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE E2 WHERE E2.SALARY>E.SAL)




------------departmentwise 2nd highest salary--------------------

SELECT * FROM (SELECT EMP.*,DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY DEPARTMENT_ID ORDER BY SALARY DESC) AS RN FROM EMP)A WHERE RN=2
